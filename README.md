# NeuroBit Website Design Prompt for Trae.ai

## Objective:
Create a **single-scrollable modern website** for **NeuroBit**, a startup offering **cloud-based, plug-and-play AI brains** for robots through flexible subscription plans. The site should be clean, futuristic, and minimal with a dark-tech aesthetic, optimized for both desktop and mobile.

## Design Requirements:
- Use all provided assets from the `/reference` folder:
  - `Top.png`: Top portion of the scrollable homepage
  - `Bottom.png`: Bottom portion of the scrollable homepage
  - `Logo.png`: Official NeuroBit logo
- **Replace the "RoboBrain" text** in the header (in `Top.png`) with the `Logo.png` to reflect the correct branding.
- The entire website should be a **single-scrollable page**, visually flowing from the top to the bottom.
- Ensure all elements and sections maintain consistent visual hierarchy, with a **futuristic, dark, minimal UI**.

## Content Structure (Based on Scroll Flow):
1. **Hero Section** — Eye-catching intro with core value proposition and CTA buttons (from `Top.png`)
2. **Features Section** — Showcase AI features: cloud-based, customizable, scalable, compatible
3. **Why Choose Us** — Benefits like affordability, trial periods, easy integration
4. **How It Works** — Four-step onboarding process
5. **Customer Testimonials** — Student, hobbyist, and industry feedback
6. **Subscription Plans** — Cards for Student, Individual, Business, and Custom plans
7. **Plan Comparison Table**
8. **Frequently Asked Questions**
9. **Call to Action** — Strong final push to subscribe or contact sales
10. **Contact Section & Footer** (from `Bottom.png`) — Form, email, socials, and legal info

## Style Guidelines:
- **Dark mode theme** with glowing accents (e.g., neon blue or green highlights)
- **Minimal and modular layout** — no unnecessary clutter
- Fonts should be **sleek and modern**
- Icons and visuals should reflect AI, robotics, and cloud computing themes
- Interactive elements (e.g., toggles, CTA buttons) should be functional and smooth
## Notes:
- All assets provided are visual references for layout and section content.
- Final design should flow exactly as represented between Top.png and Bottom.png.
